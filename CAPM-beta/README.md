# CAPM Beta Scratchpad using the Messari API

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to use the Messari API to calculate Capital Asset Pricing Model betas and compares Solana's beta to Bitcoin and Ethereum.

#### Formatted Figure Example [UniSwap]:

In the figure above we see that in bull markets UniSwap displays a falling beta to Ethereum but in a bear market it exhibits a rising beta. This suggests that in a bull market it may not provide ethereum-correlated returns that justify the downsides it will inherit during bear markets. It might still be a very good purchase because of its non-ethereum correlated returns, but using it as a proxy DeFi bet may not be ideal.
